#  ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) processesAn ETL process involves extracting data from multiple sources, transforming it into a format suitable for analysis, and loading it into a database for querying and visualization. You can use Redshift, AWS, Python, and Streamlit to build an ETL pipeline that utilizes data from disparate sources such as databases, APIs, and web scraping. Streamlit will provide an interface for users to set up, manage and monitor ETL jobs as well as running ad-hoc queries that provide insight into data sources.
